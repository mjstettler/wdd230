            <h2>Moroni 1:2-3</h2>
            <p>2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because of their hatred they put to death every Nephite that will not deny the Christ.

                3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.</p>

            <h2>Alma 26:12</h2>
            <p>12 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.</p>
